    "#### Understanding Slow-Roll Inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosmological inflation, a cornerstone in our understanding of the early universe, is characterized by a phase of rapid, exponential expansion. One significant formulation within this paradigm is known as slow-roll inflation, a term that captures the gradual evolution of the inflaton field during this epoch. This exercise not only delves into the fundamental equations governing slow-roll dynamics but also provides insights into why this phase is aptly named \"slow roll.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slow-Roll Equations:** <br>\n",
    "1. $ \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = -\\frac{V'(\\phi)}{3H} $ <br>\n",
    "2. $ H^2 = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}\\right)^2 + V(\\phi)\\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the term \"Slow Roll\":**\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"slow roll\" refers to the condition where the rate of change of the inflaton field $\\phi$ is much smaller than the characteristic timescale set by the Hubble parameter $H$. This condition allows us to simplify the dynamics and leads to the slow-roll equations. The \"slowness\" of the roll ensures that the inflationary potential dominates the kinetic energy of the inflaton, leading to a nearly constant Hubble parameter during this phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",
    "1. Extend the slow-roll equations to include the number of e-folds $N$: $\\frac{d\\phi}{dN} = -\\frac{V'(\\phi)}{V(\\phi)}$ and $\\frac{dH}{dN} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{d\\phi}{dN}$ and use a quadratic potential of the form $V(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$.\n",
    "2. Integrate these equations numerically to obtain the evolution of the inflaton field and the Hubble parameter with respect to the number of e-folds.\n",
    "3. Explore how changing the initial conditions and potential parameters affect the number of e-folds and the resulting scale factor.\n",
    "4. Plot the scale factor as a function of the number of e-folds for different sets of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise allows you to see how the dynamics of inflation, as represented by the number of e-folds, influence the expansion of the universe during the inflationary epoch."

    "In this exercise, we delve into the motivations behind using alternative inflationary potentials and their implications for the early universe dynamics. Specifically, we consider two alternative potentials: the exponential potential and the hybrid potential. These alternatives arise from theoretical considerations and offer different predictions for the evolution of the inflaton field during inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exponential Potential:**\n",
    "   - **Motivation:** Inspired by chaotic inflation scenarios, the exponential potential $V(\\phi) = V_0 e^{-\\lambda\\phi}$ leads to an inflationary model where the inflaton field rolls down a very steep potential. This exponential behavior results in a prolonged inflationary epoch, providing an alternative to the quadratic potential.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Hybrid Potential:**\n",
    "   - **Motivation:** The hybrid potential $V(\\phi, \\chi) = \\frac{1}{4}\\lambda(\\phi^2 - v^2)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\chi^2$ introduces an additional field $\\chi$ interacting with the inflaton $\\phi$. This model allows for a variety of inflationary scenarios, including a phase transition at the end of inflation, leading to different observational signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise Instructions:\n",
    "1. **Select Potential:** Choose one of the alternative potentials (exponential or hybrid) and substitute it into the `inflation_potential` function.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Repeat Exercise:** Re-run the simulation using the selected potential, comparing the evolution of the inflaton field and the Hubble parameter against the number of e-folds. Consider how the dynamics differ from the quadratic potential case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis:** Discuss and analyze the results. How does the choice of inflationary potential influence the inflationary dynamics and the observable consequences? Compare and contrast the outcomes of different potentials, gaining insights into the rich variety of inflationary scenarios.\n",

Through comparative analysis, you will unveil the distinct features that arise from different theoretical motivations, shedding light on the diversity within the inflationary paradigm."

The primordial power spectrum encapsulates the amplitude of density fluctuations generated during the inflationary epoch, leaving a lasting imprint on the large-scale structure of the universe.\n",

    "The primordial power spectrum $\\mathcal{P}(k)$ quantifies the amplitude of density fluctuations as a function of the comoving wavenumber $k$. It serves as a cornerstone in understanding the origin of structure in the universe. During inflation, quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field give rise to primordial perturbations, and the power spectrum characterizes the statistical properties of these fluctuations.\n",

Consider the slow-roll parameters $(\\epsilon, \\eta)$ and their impact on $\\mathcal{P}(k)$. Use the lecture notes of D. Baumann as a starting point!\n",
