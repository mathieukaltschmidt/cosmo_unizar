    "This exercise will give you practice in using “raw”, pixel- level CMB maps. Here, our goal is to calculate the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy in a map and compare it to the theoretical prediction.\n",
    "In order to perform the tasks in this problem, you will use the software package Healpix (Gorski et al., 2005). Healpix is an ingenious algorithm to pixelize the sphere in equal-area pixels. This pixelization is hierarchical, meaning that a pixel in a higher-resolution setting neatly splits into four pixels at the resolution that is one step lower. The resolution is specified with an input parameter NSIDE which must be a power of 2 (so, 1, 2, 4, 8 etc.); a useful rule of thumb NSIDE = 64 roughly correspond to pixels that are 1◦ on a side (and then NSIDE = 128 is pixelization at about half a degree, etc). Crucially, Healpix comes with routines for Python (called healpy), but also for C and other languages as well, which make the CMB analysis possible, even easy! Having installed healpy (or equivalent for C), you may first want to familiarize yourself with Healpix’ basic commands (https://healpix.sourceforge.io/). <br>\n",
    "Go to Planck experiment’s Legacy Archive (https://pla.esac.esa.int /#maps). and find the SMICA full-sky CMB map (COM CMB IQU-smica 204 8 R3.00 full.fits). Also download a mask, say COM Mask CMB-common-Mask-Int 2048 R3.00.fits (I also provide the respective datasets in Moodle!). The mask helps cover areas likely contaminated by galactic emission (and point sources)\n",
    "and other unwanted artifacts), and consists of ones and zeros, where the zeros indicate areas to be masked. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concrete Exercises**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Calculate the angular power spectrum of the (full-sky) CMB map. You will want to make use of the Healpix function anafast. Note that anafast returns the coefficients Cl, while you will want to plot\n",
    "$D_{\\ell} ≡ \\ell(\\ell + 1)C_{\\ell} 2\\pi \\ $ \n",
    "as a function of multipole $l$. This simple analysis is expected to accurately recover the angular power spectrum only on large and intermediate (but not small) scales, so only show this and the following results in the range of, say, $\\ell ∈ [2, 300]$, so capturing the first acoustic peak.\n",
    "2) Compare this measurement with the best-fit theoretical model. You could calculate the latter yourself using some standard software (camb or class). Do the measurements from part 1) match the theory in part b)? Why?\n",
    "3) Repeat the analysis from part 1), but now mask out the area around the Galactic plane. To do that, apply the Planck mask that you downloaded to the SMICA map. There are a few ways to do this; it may be simplest to multiply the map pixel values with the corresponding mask values. The resulting map will have zero temperature in pixels to which the map has been applied. Now repeat the anafast analysis. Without further adjustments, you should find that, in contrast to part b), the measured power is now somewhat smaller than the theory expectation. Why do you think that is?\n",
    "4) To fix up the result in part 3), it is useful to re-read the “A very naive approach” paragraph a bit below Eq. (13.77) in the provided section of the book by Huterer (\"Notes_Exercise2.pdf\"). Clearly, we need to correct the measured power for the missing, masked area. To do that, simply rescale all $D_{\\ell}$ by $1/f_{\\mathrm{sky}}$, where $f_{\\mathrm{sky}}$ is the unmasked fraction of the sky area. The measured angular power spectrum should now match the theory quite well over the range of multipoles suggested in part 1)."
